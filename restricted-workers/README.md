# Restricted Workers Library

This library provides an abstract interface for running various kinds
of workers under resource restrictions. It was originally developed as
part of the
interactive-diagrams (<http://github.com/co-dan/interactive-diagrams)
project. To read more about security restrictions read my GSoC report:

The library provides Worker and RestartingPool abstractions for as
well as configurable security and resource restrictions settings.
